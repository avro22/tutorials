    "The first part of the tutorial looks at PID control. Below are some objectives to be achieved by the end of the tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objectives:**\n",
    "* Implement the PID control equations.\n",
    "* Tune the PID controller gains to achieve a suitable response.\n",
    "* Gain an intuitive understanding of how changing control gains affects the system response.\n",
    "\n",
    "## PID Control\n",
    "\n",
    "A proportional–integral–derivative controller (PID controller) is a type of feedback or closed-loop controller that is widely used in industrial control systems. The PID controller calculates an error $e(t)$ at each time step $h$. This error value is the difference between a reference or target $r(t)$ and an actual output or controlled variable $y(t)$. The controller works by reducing the error by adjusting the control variable $u(t)$, based on the weighted sum of the proportional, integral and derivative terms with their respective gains. \n",
    "\n",
    "An everday example of feedback control is cruise control, where the driver sets a target speed and the controller has to work to reduce the error between its current  and target speed. The cruise controller may have other requirements such as having minimal delay and not overshooting the target speed. "
